## FEATURE:

Build a modern, responsive tic-tac-toe web game for two players to play on the same device. The game should be built as a Next.js application with TypeScript, featuring:
- Clean, intuitive UI with animations and visual feedback
- Two-player local gameplay (X and O taking turns)
- Score tracking across multiple games
- Win detection with visual highlighting of winning combinations
- Game reset and new game functionality
- Mobile-responsive design
- Deployable to GitHub Pages or Vercel

## EXAMPLES:

No examples folder provided yet - will create interactive game examples during development showing:
- Standard gameplay flow
- Win conditions (horizontal, vertical, diagonal)
- Draw/tie game scenarios
- Score persistence during session

## DOCUMENTATION:

Key documentation to reference:
- Next.js 14+ documentation: https://nextjs.org/docs
- React 18 hooks and state management
- Tailwind CSS for styling: https://tailwindcss.com/docs
- TypeScript for type safety
- GitHub Pages deployment guide for Next.js apps
- Vercel deployment documentation

## OTHER CONSIDERATIONS:

- **Accessibility**: Ensure keyboard navigation and screen reader support for inclusive gameplay
- **Performance**: Keep bundle size minimal, use React.memo where appropriate for re-render optimization
- **State Management**: Use React hooks (useState, useEffect) rather than external state libraries for simplicity
- **Testing**: Include basic unit tests for game logic (win detection, turn management)
- **Browser Compatibility**: Ensure works on modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- **No Backend Required**: All game logic should run client-side
- **Clean Code Structure**: Separate game logic from UI components for maintainability
- **Git-friendly**: Include proper .gitignore, README with setup instructions, and clear commit history
- **Visual Polish**: Include hover states, smooth transitions, and clear visual feedback for player actions
- **Error Handling**: Gracefully handle edge cases and prevent invalid moves
